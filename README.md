# Control of Humanoid Robot Motion on Uneven Surfaces using Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project explores the use of deep reinforcement learning to control the motion of humanoid robots on uneven surfaces, enabling them to adapt dynamically while maintaining balance and fluid motion.

## Final Simulations

Here are the final simulation GIFs demonstrating the robot's performance on different surfaces:
